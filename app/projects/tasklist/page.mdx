A simple task tracking app created for a local law firm

## The Problem

A local law firm was missing an application that was critical to their everyday function: an app to keep track of their tasks and due dates. After learning more about what they truly needed, I began development work.

## Requirements

The team at the law firm had been using the Outlook To-do feature, and needed a replacement after they lost access to it. After discussing their need a little bit more, we decided on a core set of features:

-  Create, edit, and delete lists
-  Create, edit, and delete tasks
-  Tasks would have a name and due date
-  Lists should be optionally collaborative, allowing multiple people to work on it simultaneously
-  An option to choose whether updates others made would happen live or not

### My Takeaway

Based on these requirements, I decided on a lightweight React application, that I would build using Vite. To facilitate the live update feature, I settled on [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) (RTDB).
